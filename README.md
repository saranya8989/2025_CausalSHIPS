Welcome to the Causal SHIPS Project Repository
===============================================

Main Contributors: Dr. Saranya Ganesh S., Frederick Iat Hin Tam

Repository Overview:

Part 1: ERA5 replication experiments — serves as a tutorial with step-by-step Jupyter notebooks. Users can follow this to learn how the causal experiments are implemented.

Part 2 & 3: Analysis of SHIPS developmental data (baseline and new predictors) and MLP/SHAP experiments — these scripts were used directly for the manuscript and are more “production-style” than the tutorial.

The "util" directory contains reusable helper modules used by the main scripts.

Check README.txt for all the details
